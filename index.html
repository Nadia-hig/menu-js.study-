            <div class="page__text">
               <p>A cactus (plural cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus)[3] is a member of the plant family
                  Cactaceae,[a] a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order
                  Caryophyllales.[4] The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος
                  (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not
                  certain.[5] Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Although some species live in quite humid
                  environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry
                  environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. Because of
                  this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. For example, almost all cacti are succulents,
                  meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the
                  stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have
                  lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending
                  against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and
                  providing some shade. In the absence of true leaves, cacti's enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis.
                  Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in
                  the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.
               </p>
               <p>Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced
                  branch. Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers,
                  which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have short growing seasons and long dormancies
                  and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root
                  system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or
                  fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain,
                  followed by retention over long drought periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a
                  special mechanism called "crassulacean acid metabolism" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis.
                  Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place
                  during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the
                  carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it
                  in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water
                  loss is significantly reduced.
               </p>
               <p>Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage
                  with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration. The tallest[b] free-standing
                  cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft),[7] and the smallest
                  is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity.[8] A fully grown saguaro
                  (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of
                  water during a rainstorm.[9] A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family.
                  At least superficially, plants of the genera Leuenbergeria, Rhodocactus and Pereskia resemble other
                  trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems.
                  Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many
                  adaptations for water conservation. Leuenbergeria is considered close to the ancestral species from
                  which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes
                  (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with
                  fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus
                  Schlumbergera).
               </p>
               <p>Cacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder
                  or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect that
                  lives on some cacti.
               </p>
               <p>Many succulent plants in both the Old and New World – such as some Euphorbiaceae (euphorbias) – are
                  also spiny stem succulents and because of this are sometimes incorrectly referred to as
                  "cactus".[citation needed]

               <p>The 1,500 to 1,800 species of cacti mostly fall into one of two groups of "core cacti": opuntias
                  (subfamily Opuntioideae) and "cactoids" (subfamily Cactoideae). Most members of these two groups are
                  easily recognizable as cacti. They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of
                  photosynthesis. They have absent, small, or transient leaves. They have flowers with ovaries that lie
                  below the sepals and petals, often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle (the part of the stem from
                  which the flower parts grow). All cacti have areoles—highly specialized short shoots with extremely
                  short internodes that produce spines, normal shoots, and flowers.[10]
               </p>
               <p>The remaining cacti fall into only two groups: three tree-like genera, Leuenbergeria, Pereskia and
                  Rhodocactus (all formerly placed in Pereskia), and the much smaller Maihuenia. These two groups are
                  rather different from other cacti,[10] which means any description of cacti as a whole must frequently
                  make exceptions for them. Species of the first three genera superficially resemble other tropical
                  forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may be covered with bark and long-lasting leaves
                  that provide the main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above
                  the points of attachment of the sepals and petals) and areoles that produce further leaves. The two
                  species of Maihuenia have succulent but non-photosynthetic stems and prominent succulent leaves.[10]

            <div class="page__text">
               <p>Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high mountain areas. With one exception, they
                  are native to the Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta
                  in western Canada. A number of centers of diversity exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three
                  main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are
                  found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin.
                  Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they
                  require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of
                  southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which is the center of diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and
                  in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.[43]
               </p>
               <p>Rhipsalis baccifera is the exception; it is native to both the Americas and the Old World, where it is
                  found in tropical Africa, Madagascar, and Sri Lanka. One theory is it was spread by being carried as
                  seeds in the digestive tracts of migratory birds; the seeds of Rhipsalis are adapted for bird
                  distribution. Old World populations are polyploid, and regarded as distinct subspecies, supporting the
                  idea that the spread was not recent.[44] The alternative theory is the species initially crossed the
                  Atlantic on European ships trading between South America and Africa, after which birds may have spread
                  it more widely.[45]
